map stack set

Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates) means 0 to the exercise?

checking NULL from allocator?

know what explicit means


remove assertions
do TODOs
remove all new's that should be allocs

up next:
	erase, implement the node part
		- implement rebalance
		- i think I just need a copy constructor for avlnodes, the error output is very confusing now, probably because of the implicit copy assignment?
		somewhere te string turns to const. Why?
		class Alloc = std::allocator<pair<const Key,T> > >
		so.... I can't replace keys?
		so in erase, I need to 
		- working on the end of erase, about line 270, to make sure the this is replaced by the next

		the allocator thinks the string is const?
	all the other functions
	avl tree should use the map allocator

check all nodes for rebalancing? or only parts where there has been an insertion or deletion?
