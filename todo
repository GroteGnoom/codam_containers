map stack set

Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates) means 0 to the exercise?

checking NULL from allocator?

know what explicit means


todo forever:
remove assertions
do TODOs
no new or delete where there should be an alloc;

up next:
	stack
	clean up!
	for vector operator = you should preserve the allocator
	lots of things private
	make map more balanced
	functions like advance?
	https://m.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/
	there's still TODO's
	use hint for map insert?
	container of stack needs to be protected?

check all nodes for rebalancing? or only parts where there has been an insertion or deletion?

checked:
vector:
	typedefs
	constructors
	destructors
	iterators
	capacity
	element access
	modifiers
	allocator
	non-member function overloads
	not too much public
	iterator
	reverse_iterator

map:
	
	iterator
	reverse_iterator

	Iterators
	Capacity
	Element access
	Modifiers
	Observers
	Operations
	Allocator

done:
check if there's some way to replace compare_key with value_compare
fix map iterator, things go immediately wrong when looping over them now
