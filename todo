map stack set

Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates) means 0 to the exercise?

checking NULL from allocator?

know what explicit means


todo forever:
remove assertions
do TODOs
no new or delete where there should be an alloc;

up next:
	clean up!
	for vector operator = you should preserve the allocator
	lots of things private
	make map more balanced
	functions like advance?
	https://m.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/

check all nodes for rebalancing? or only parts where there has been an insertion or deletion?

checked:
vector:
	typedefs
	constructors
	destructors
	iterators
	capacity
	element access
	modifiers
	allocator
	non-member function overloads
	not too much public
	iterator
	reverse_iterator

map:
	
	iterator
	reverse_iterator


std::pair


done:
check if there's some way to replace compare_key with value_compare
fix map iterator, things go immediately wrong when looping over them now
