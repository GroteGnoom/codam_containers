map stack set

Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates) means 0 to the exercise?

checking NULL from allocator?

know what explicit means


todo forever:
remove assertions
do TODOs
no new or delete where there should be an alloc;

up next:
	be able to erase the root
	make in /ext
	clang++ -fsanitize=address main.cpp -g -I.. && ./a.out
	for vector operator = you should preserve the allocator
	lots of things private?
	make map more balanced

check all nodes for rebalancing? or only parts where there has been an insertion or deletion?


done:
check if there's some way to replace compare_key with value_compare
fix map iterator, things go immediately wrong when looping over them now
