map stack set

Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates) means 0 to the exercise?

checking NULL from allocator?

know what explicit means


remove assertions
do TODOs
remove all new's that should be allocs

up next:
//NOW for the line I'm working on
	mayeb I should just move find to the tree, instread of having it at the node, because that could give me more const problems? Like I can change the node in a const tree, but not a node in a const node.
	fix map iterator, things go immediately wrong when looping over them now
	why is this ok?
	-------node*	find(const value_type& val) const
	why doesn't the node* have to point to something const
		because you can't actually change the members of the tree, because that only has a root pointer, and the value of that pointer will not be changed
	and then the outside world will not notice a problem because te map itself converts it to a const_iterator
	only use iterators at the map level, the rest just uses pointers
	avl tree should use the map allocator
	for vector operator = you should preserve the allocator

check all nodes for rebalancing? or only parts where there has been an insertion or deletion?


check if there's some way to replace compare_key with value_compare
