map stack set

Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates) means 0 to the exercise?

checking NULL from allocator?

know what explicit means


remove assertions
do TODOs
remove all new's that should be allocs

up next:
	const_iterator find (const key_type& k) const;
		
	all the other functions
	avl tree should use the map allocator

check all nodes for rebalancing? or only parts where there has been an insertion or deletion?


check if there's some way to replace compare_key with value_compare
